# I Will Be Back

As students in a busy city, safety is our topmost concern. We need to stay connected, so that in case of an emergency,
others can quickly find out about it and take action. **I'll Be Back** allows students to easily share their location
with the people they trust, in case of an emergency.

**I'll Be Back** uses NodeJS and Express for backend, and React with Recoil handle the front end. We integrated our
application with Twilio to notify the trustees and uses Google Maps API to display the walker's current location.
